# Contributing to HESTIA

We welcome contributions to HESTIA! Whether you're interested in fixing bugs, adding new features, or helping with documentation, your contributions are greatly appreciated.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the project's [Code of Conduct](). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute to the OHDSI project, and we value all forms of contributions. Here are some ways you can help:

### Reporting Issues
- Before submitting an issue, please check the issue tracker to avoid duplicates.
- Use the issue templates to provide as much information as possible.
- Describe the issue clearly and provide steps to reproduce if possible.

### Submitting Changes
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository and cloning your fork to your local machine.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch in your fork for your changes. Use a clear and descriptive name for your branch.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Make the necessary changes. Keep your changes as focused as possible; if you find multiple issues or improvements, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) format. This standardizes commit messages and facilitates the automatic generation of changelogs.
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original OHDSI repository, and you should see a prompt to submit a pull request from your new branch. Provide as much information as possible in the pull request template.

## Coding Standards

### OHDSI Alignment
- Implementations should be guided by the [Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/) and [OMOP Common Data Model v5.4](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/index.html)

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- Write tests for your changes when applicable.
- Document your changes in the project's documentation if your changes introduce new features or changes in behavior.
- Pull requests undergo a review process, so be open to feedback and be prepared to make adjustments.
- The project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate the generation of changelogs based on commit messages. Ensure your commit messages are clear and follow the Conventional Commits format to aid in this process.

### Documentation
Improving documentation, tutorials, or examples is a valuable way to contribute. You can submit changes to documentation the same way as code changes through pull requests.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

A devcontainter.json is included for VSCode / Docker users. This is the easiest way to get started on a local machine.
